# Win10Guide

Introduction

* * *

This guide will cover everything you need to know about (re-)installing Microsoft Windows 10 on your computer. From Backup considerations, Firewall- and Privacy settings to recommendations of useful (and free) tools for essential work.

This guide is intended for the beginner and hobbyist user, and while it may encourage you to dive into some deeper settings, it will always be explained why you should do so. Some optional and extended knowledge is required to do certain things, such as showing hidden folders in Windows Explorer. These comprehensive explanations are contained in the supplementary section and referenced when needed for a better overview.

Every recommendation in this guide is optional and can be ignored or changed for creating a Windows environment that *works for you*. Multiple options are given when available, considering why to use one program or plugin over another.

This guide, however, strongly recommends doing a fresh install of MS Windows 10 and **not** do an "upgrade". It means re-formatting your main hard disc or hard disc partition and do a clean installation of MS Windows 10. History has shown that while an upgrade installation works, it tends to lead to a much slower and unstable environment than doing the extra steps of a fresh install.

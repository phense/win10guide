You can then use the available space on the USB Flash Drive. You are aware that you want to re-format your Main Hard Drive Partition (the one that contains a previous version of MS Windows or another Operating System) with a new File System and a fresh Installation of MS Windows 10. Therefore, you need to save all the old data first. This excludes all installed Applications and Games, the Windows Registry and Restore Points of your current Operating System. However, your Application Settings can be saved and later restored (for most applications). Let\u2019s open the overview of your available Hard Disk Partitions under Windows by pressing the \u229e Win Key on your Keyboard or clicking the Symbol in your Taskbar to open the Windows Start Menu. There, select \u2018This PC\u2019, and a new window will show up. Here an example: Note If you have only one Hard Drive Partition available, namely \u2018Local Disk (C:)\u2019, you have to be acutely aware that installing Windows 10 on this partition will wipe the File System and therefore also delete all data. All files that need to be copied from \u2018Local Disk (C:)\u2019 should be contained in C:\\Users\\'Username'\\ . In the Explorer Window that we just opened, double-click on \u2018Local Disk (C:)\u2019, then navigate (by double-clicking) to the C:\\Users\\ Folder. Right-click on your C:\\Users\\'Username'\\ Folder to open the Context-Menu, select (click) \u2018Properties\u2019 like so And a new window will open, showing you the basic Properties of this Folder. Most important is the \u2018Size on disk\u2019 value. Here is an example from a live System This Folder can contain everything from 2-3 GB, up to an obscene amount of data. This data needs to be saved. This means you need at least this amount of available space, somewhere not on \u2018Local Disk (C:)\u2019. It can be one of: another internal Hard Disk an external Hard Disk / SSD USB-Stick or a Cloud-Service, such as Google Drive, Microsoft Onedrive, Dropbox, etc. writeable media, such as writable Blu-ray Discs (needs BD-ROM drive) Anything is fine as long as it can hold the amount of data shown on your C:\\Users\\'Username'\\ folder. If there is no such option readily available, then there are two things that can still be done about it: find out what takes up a lot of space, and consider if you need this Data in the future. If not, delete it Split a portion of your File-System into a new, temporary Partition and copy the Folder there.

It\u2019s not a standard term but a commonly-used one. While the strictest definition would be the physical device that stores data, it is often used informally to refer to any storage device, from a disk to a volume. Technically, its meaning is restricted to describing a hardware device. It is the device that you buy in your computer store. Current typical examples for hard drives are the big, clunky Hard Disk Drives (HDD), Solid State Disks (SSD) and M.2 SSD\u2019s, also known as PCI Express NVMe SSD\u2019s. But it is not what you are directly working on when you work on your PC. For any operating system to perform read and write data from a hard drive, the hard drive needs a filesystem. Partitions and Filesystems The typical filesystem for Windows 7/8/10 is called NTFS. The (very) outdated filesystem from yesteryear is called FAT32, mostly used in Windows XP and below. A modernized version of FAT32 is called exFAT, mainly used as an optional filesystem for USB Flash Drives. Here is the crucial part: A hard drive can contain a partition that spans over the entire disk or contains multiple, separate partitions. It is commonly referred to as partitioning . To be more precise: A partition is a chunk of hard drive that contains a filesystem. This is, in itself, a straightforward concept to understand. However, it gets confusing in Windows because Microsoft decided to make everything user-friendly and hide this from the standard view. When you open Your PC Window (from the Start Menu), Windows will show you your partitions , as well as all connected Flash Drives, mounted Virtual Disks as well as Floppy Disk Drives and CD/DVD/BD Drives. Here is an example: It shows the physical BD-RE Drive, but only partitions, and then calls them \u201cDisk\u201d, which can lead to confusion and problems later, when we need to re-format the partition that contained the old Operating System. In the picture above, you can see multiple disks, and it looks like they all might be partitions that span entire Hard Disks, but it would be equally possible that \u201cBackup\u201d and \u201cOld\u201d are just two partitions on a 4TB HDD. It is impossible to tell. To see what\u2019s going on, we need to open the Windows Disk Manager. To do this, we start with opening the Start-Menu by pressing \u229e Win or the Run-Menu by pressing \u229e Win + R and type diskmgmt.msc and press Enter. Alternatively, you can open the Start-Menu and navigate to Control Panel > Administrative Tools > Computer Management . Inside Computer Management you can select Disk Management and will be greeted with a window displaying all the physical Hard Drives in the computer, as well as the partitions and their file system on them. In my example, it looks like this: Here we can see that, yes, the partitions span the entire physical Hard Drives. Let\u2019s ignore the small partitions on the system drive, as this is something that Windows will automatically do during the installation. Keep your Hard Disk and partition layout in mind; you will need it later. Programs, Files and %APPDATA% Let\u2019s talk about programs for a bit. If we ignore portable programs, then the standard programs (or games) come with an Installer, which typically installs many files in a directory of your choice, by default the C:\\Programs or C:\\Programs (x86) Folders on the Systems partition (C:). A program (or game) that comes with an installer usually includes multiple executable files, like the main program, an updater and an uninstaller. For some programs, the configuration can be unimportant or is quickly set up. Examples are Libre Office and Microsoft Office. However, for some programs and especially games, the configuration can either require a long time to set up or outright need keys and files that cannot easily be replaced. For example, customized User Interfaces in games, the Server list for Teamspeak- or IRC Clients, SSH private keys for Github Repositories, AES private keys for GnuPG and Mail. And how do you save Website Passwords? Is it within the Webbrowser directly, a Browser-Plugin using encrypted Cloud Storage, or on stacks of paper notes stuffed together in the upper desk drawer? But where do all the programs save the configurations and essential files? And the answer is %APPDATA% , a System variable that links to C:\\Users\\<Username>\\AppData\\ . However, you can open the Windows File Explorer (open the Start Menu with \u229e Win and type File Explorer) and type %APPDATA% and press Enter to enter said folder. However, when you navigate to C:\\Users\\<Username>\\ , the AppData folder has become invisible. The AppData folder is hidden from the normal view to prevent normal users from accidentally deleting the folder and loose all their valuable program configurations. The File Explorer can access the option to display hidden files and folders. Inside the File Explorer, select View > Options > Change folder and search options and a option window will appear. Select the View Tab. Somewhere in the options list (depending on your current Windows version) will be the option Show hidden files, folders and drives . The AppData Folder will show up now. This is important since installing a new Windows will delete all the data on the partition, and programs (and games) cannot just be copied somewhere else and then copied back. They all need to be re-installed, too. However, your AppData Folder can be copied and saved, together with all other folders and files inside the C:\\Users\\<Username>\\ directory. It can only be selected and copied if it isn\u2019t hidden from view.","title":"Drives, Partitions and Programs"},{"location":"drives/#about-hard-drives-partitions-and-programs","text":"All the things you need to know to avoid confusion","title":"About Hard Drives, Partitions and Programs"},{"location":"drives/#hard-drive-disk","text":"A Hard Drive is a physical device that\u2019s used to store data.

This is especially so for the C:\\Users\\'Username'\\AppData folder. A nice, free tool to visualize which subfolders of C:\\Users\\'Username'\\ take up a lot of space, and might not be needed for a Backup, is called SpaceSniffer . Download it, start the application and point it at your C:\\Users\\'Username'\\ folder, like so: Let it run for a while until there are no more big changes to the picture. Let\u2019s have a look at the view of my C:\\Users\\Zyrkon\\ Folder: Each square represents a folder (or subfolder) and the size of said folder. The size of each square also represents the size in relation to all other folders. The bigger the square, the more space it needs. In my example, the folder C:\\Users\\'Username'\\AppData\\Local\\ModOrganizer contains 12.1 GB worth of Skyrim Mods. A game I long since uninstalled and forgotten. This is a folder that I know I can delete because I know what it contains, and I know I do not need it any longer. The next biggest square in SpaceSniffer is the folder C:\\Users\\'Username'\\AppData\\Local\\Spotify . In this case, I am not so sure of the content, but I am sure that Spotify itself only needs 100 MB or 200 MB in itself. As a music streaming service, I suspect that most of the 6.8 GB of data contains temporary files from music streaming. Clicking on the Spotify-square inside SpaceSniffer will focus on the Spotify folder as the base. And certainly enough, the Data subfolder contains almost all the data. Using a Google search for making sure (ex.: \u2018Can I delete the Spotify data folder\u2019), I find that yes, I can delete the content of the Data folder (but not the folder itself). The general rule for cleaning up your filesystem in this way is to delete folders or files when you are confident that you can do so. If you do not know what the files do, you should not delete them. Three easy ways to make space Open the Recycle Bin on your Desktop, check the content to make sure all files can be irrevocably deleted, and click the Empty Recycle Bin - Button. From the This PC -Window we can right-click on Local Drive (C:) and open the `Properties-Window, like so: Here we can click on Disk Clean-up . Windows will collect all data that we can safely delete: In your preferred Web-Browser, open the Options or Settings. Depending on your browser, there will be a button to clear your Browser-Data. In Google Chrome, we can find this under Settings (3 dots) > More Tools > Clear browsing data. Select the time range \u2018All time\u2019 and deselect \u2018Cookies\u2019. In Firefox we can find this under Options > Privacy & Security > Clear Data\u2026 as shown below: Deselect Cookies and delete the rest: Compressing Pictures With Smartphones, it has become common to take lots and lots of pictures. Eventually, these pictures get transferred to the Computer to make room on the Smartphone. In the best case, the images get sorted by year and event with a proper file structure, or in the worst case get dumped into one big folder. The Pictures can take up a massive amount of disk space. Initially, it is good to have the pictures in a very high resolution because it will produce better results for editing or printing. However, when archiving images just for looking at them later, we can radically reduce the picture size, and therefore the file size. An easy way to do so is by using the free tool Mass Image Compressor . After downloading and installing the tool, we can point it at any folder structure and select the quality and maximum image size for each picture. My recommendation is to use a picture quality of 80% and a fixed image width of 1920 (pixel): . When compressing multiple folders (and subfolders) of pictures all at once, the program will replace the new image files with new ones. The other option is to go folder by folder and let the program create a new subfolder with all the newly generated images inside. Compressing Videoclips What can be said about images can be said about videos, too. There are some free tools available online, together with instructions on youtube on how to use them. Two such tools are the Freemake Video Converter and the HandBrake Video Transcoder . Keep in mind that converting large video files will take a long time, depending on your CPU. Another way to effortlessly convert videos is to upload them to youtube as private, unpublished videos. Youtube will run all its video quality enhancement- and video compression algorithms over the footage, and we can finally download the new video file back from youtube. To do so will require a free account on youtube as well as a fast internet connection.","title":"Find Space"},{"location":"findspace/#find-space","text":"by reducing or deleting unnecessary files","title":"Find Space"},{"location":"findspace/#having-a-first-look","text":"If we want to find the big eaters of space hidden or forgotten inside a specific folder or partition, we need a way to visualize the size of all subfolders in an easy to use manner.
